## user story
I have and empty league. I add 2 hats - strong and weak players. In a hat I will add 4-4 players. I will raffle into two groups (A and B). In a group there will be two strong and two weak player. This step will generate the matches. A match will have scores and there will be 6 match in that case in a group. At the end of the matches of a group the programme will choose the two best player into a knock match.
